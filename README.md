# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD
This project focuses on building a fraud detection model for credit card transactions using a dataset containing transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. We are working with a highly unbalanced dataset and the challenge lies in effectively detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
